# Full-Stack-JS-Test

Create photo gallery API using NodeJS for backend and Angular/React/Vue for frontend.

#### Functionality we must implement

- We must have an endpoint for uploading, editing, deleteing, getting list of images (CRUD)
- User must authorize with username and password, so we must have Sign in and Sign up functionality (Facebook Authorization will be a plus)
- In frontend we must have ability to drag-n-drop multiple files for uploading, also we must be able to browse them
- Must have separate progress bars for each file
- Each photo must have title, location, date
- Location must be selected on google map
- In frontend we must have 3 separate views for uploading new photos, viewing list of already uploaded photos, and updateing exisitng photos.

Please consider that we will have billions of photos, please think about how you will save photos, for best performance.

Don't focus on CSS deeply. It can have poor design.<br>

Do as much as you can and send us the code in archive (.zip) or in GIT for review.
